# Scene templates are used by the in-game "Scene designer". That is when you use "new script, 
# "add waypoint", "add target", etc.
#
# You can modify this template to your heart's content and it will be used by any scene you
# create from then on.
#
# The software will insert waypoints (etc) at e.g. $$CAMERA_MOVE_...
# There is no magic here, it's just a simple substitution of text done when saving a new script.
