# Get your motor runnin'
# Head out on the highway
# Lookin' for adventure
# And whatever comes our way
# Yeah Darlin' go make it happen
# Take the world in a love embrace
# Fire all of your guns at once
# And explode into space
#
# I like smoke and lightning
# Heavy metal thunder
# Racin' with the wind
# And the feelin' that I'm under
# Yeah Darlin' go make it happen
# Take the world in a love embrace
# Fire all of your guns at once
# And explode into space
#
# Like a true nature's child
# We were born, born to be wild
# We can climb so high
# I never wanna die
